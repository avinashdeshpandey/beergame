# beergame
This is a python based beer game simulation(wip) to demonstrate bullwhip effect.

We are simulating 40-weeks.

The supply chain consists of;

RETAILER->WHOLESELLER->DISTRIBUTOR->MANUFACTURER


YOU PLAY AS A RETAILER and you have to INPUT;
  1) WEEKLY ORDER QUANTITY = in the given input-box and press Enter (you do this 40-times)
  2) mean and standard devaiation for your customer demand (you may change this for every week or retain the same values)
   
Rest of the data is generated randomly

As a retailer all you have to do is; enter ORDER
