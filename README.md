# beergame
This is a python based beer game simulation(wip) to demonstrate bullwhip effect.

We are simulating 40-weeks.

The supply chain consists of;

RETAILER->WHOLESELLER->DISTRIBUTOR->MANUFACTURER


YOU PLAY AS A RETAILER and you have to INPUT;
  1) WEEKLY ORDER QUANTITY (Q) = volume (Q) you want to order and press Enter (you do this 40-times)
                             (This order (Q) has arrival-lead time of 1-week, i.e if you order in ith week, it will come after (i+1)th week)
  3) mean and standard devaiation for your customer demand (you may change this for every week or retain the same values)
   
The data for wholeseller, distributor & manufacturer is generated randomly.
